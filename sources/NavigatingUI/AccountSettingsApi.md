#API Tokens
This is where you generate, view and manage access tokens to use our [API](../../api).

##Adding a token
To add a token:

- Click the 'Add Tokens' button.
- Enter a token name and click on `Add` to create a new token.
- IMPORTANT: Remember to copy the token. For security reasons, the token will never be displayed again.

**Please remember to keep your token safe and do not share it with anyone.** If anyone gets access to your token, they will be able to make API calls on your behalf and compromise the security of your Shippable account. Treat your API token like a password.
