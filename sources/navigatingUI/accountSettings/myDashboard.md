#My Dashboard
You can add a custom dashboard to your account which will show the latest statuses of selected projects, this will reduce clutter on your dashboard and gives you a more streamlined and customized view.  
Optionally you can set one of these custom dashboards as default and that dashboard view will load whenever you go to your home page
