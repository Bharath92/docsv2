# What are Machine images?
A Machine image is an pre-baked image that contains all the necessary components 
installed. This is used to spin up minions for running your CI, RunSH & RunCLI 
jobs on it. Every subscription (org/team depending on SCM you use) has a default
version of the machine image configured. This default is setup whenever the first
CI or Pipeline job is configured. 

The following picture shows the relationship between the build machine and the 
build container. The build container is spun up on the build machine using either 
the default Docker image depending the `language` tag in your yml configuration 
or a custom Docker image if specified in the yml.

We currently offer the following Machine Images. You can click on any one to see 
what is pre-installed on that image:

| Machine Image | Release date     |
|---------------|-------------------|
| [v5.4.1](v5-4-1/)        | Mar 30, 2017    |
| [v5.3.2](v5-3-2/)        | Mar 11, 2017    |
| [Stable](stable/)        | Feb 19, 2016 (deprecated) |

**The default Machine Image for your subscription is the latest image available 
when your Subscription was added to Shippable.**

In most cases, the default Machine image set for your Subscription will be 
sufficient to run your builds. The main reasons why you might want to consider 
changing to a more recent image are:

* You need a newer language/service/package version
* You need a newer Docker version
