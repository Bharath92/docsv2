# CI Project Dashboard

This page walks through the details on the Project Dashboard, which gives you details on your Current Builds and Build History for your project.

## How do you get here?

- Login to [Shippable](https://shippable.com)
- Click on **CI** on the Shippable Landing Page and choose the appropriate subscription
- This brings you to the [Subscriptions Dashboard](ci_dashboard). If your project is enabled, it will show up on the dashboard. If not, click on the ![add icon](images/enable_icon.gif) to enable your project
- Click on the project name

The Project Dashboard has panels for Current Build and Build History for each branch.

## Current Builds

The Current Build section shows the **commit** builds in progress for all branches in your project. If there are any PR builds, they will show up in the [PR builds](pr_builds) tab.

## Active Branches Toggle

By default, the dashboard only shows details about the active branch. If you would like to see all branches for the project, set the toggle to **OFF**
