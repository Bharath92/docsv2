## Custom Variables
You can also set your own environment variables in the yml.

Each statement under the ```env``` tag will trigger a separate build with that env variable, so specifying multiple environment variables will give you a build matrix for every commit.

```yaml
# environment variable
env:
 - FOO=foo BAR=bar
 - FOO=bar BAR=foo
```

Env variables can create an exponential number of builds when combined with `jdk` & `rvm , node_js etc.` i.e. it is multiplicative.

For an example, please check out the [Matrix Builds section](/ci/advancedOptions/matrixBuilds/).

To avoid a matrix build and kick off a single build with all environments, you can use the global tag as detailed in the ['Combining multiple variables in a single build'](/ci/advancedOptions/environmentVariables/#combining-multiple-variables-in-a-single-build) section below.

## Secure variables

Shippable allows you to encrypt environment variables and keep your configurations private using `secure` tag.

To do this,

1. Encrypt your environment variables ([Instructions here](/navigatingUI/projects/settings/#encrypt-section))
2. Copy the encrypted output string and add it to your yml file as shown below:

```
env:
  secure: <encrypted output>
```

---
<a name="multi_vars"></a>
## Combining multiple variables in a single build

You can combine multiple environment variables in the same build using the `global` tag.

This will prevent a build matrix for being triggered and all your variables will be defined for one build.

```yaml
env:
  global:
    - FOO="bar"
    - secure: <encrypted output>
```

---

##Injecting Global Env Variables
You can inject global environment variables into the new build by specifying key-value pairs in the request body while [triggering a new build](/api/apiProject/#trigger-a-new-run) .

These key-value pairs have to be set in the `globalEnv` property.

```
{
  "globalEnv": {
    "FOO": "bar",
    "FIZZ": "buzz"
  }
}
```

To encrypt multiple environment variables separately, configure your yml file as shown below:

```
env:
  global:
    #encrypted output of first env variable
    - secure: <encrypted output>
    #encrypted output of second env variable
    - secure: <encrypted output>
  matrix:
    #encrypted output of third env variable
    - secure: <encrypted output>
```

> **Note**
>
> Due to the security risk of exposing your secure variables, we do not decrypt secure variables for pull request from the forks of public projects.

> Secure variable decryption is limited to the pull request triggered from the branches on the same repository.

> And the decrypted secured variables are also not displayed in the script tab for security reasons.
