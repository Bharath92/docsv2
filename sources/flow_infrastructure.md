# Configuring infrastructure for your application
Before you can start configuring services for your application, you need to configure the underlying infrastructure. Shippable supports 2 ways of doing this:

- Using an existing cluster on your Container Service, or
- Creating your infrastructure through Shippable by providing us with a configuration file. Currently, we support the <a href="https://www.terraform.io" target=_blank>terraform format</a>. 

## Using an existing cluster



## Terraform



## Support for additional config management tools
