# Configuring your application




This section walks you through the workflow for configuring your application pipeline. We think of pipelines as the flow of your application from source control->ci->image->





At a high level, you need to follow the steps below:

**Configure your infrastructure** You can choose existing infrastructure or provision new infrastructure through Shippable by providing a configuration file.

**Configure your pipelines** 

**Deploy your application** 


##Provisioning application infrastructure 
Before you can deploy your application, you need to provision the infrastructure you want to run your environment on. You can also choose to run your application on already existing infrastructure.

For more details and a guide on how to provision your application infrastructure, read the [Application infrastructure section](flow_infrastructure.md) 

Once you have configured the infrastructure, you're ready to start configuring the application. More on that in the [Configuring services section](flow_configure.md)
