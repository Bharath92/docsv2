## How do you get here?

- Login to [Shippable](http://shippable.com)
- Click on the Account Settings icon on the top nav bar

## Add a New Account Integration

### Docker Hub

You will need this to pull or push images to Docker Hub as part of building your project.

1. To add a new integration, click on ![add_icon](images/add_icon.gif)
3. **Master Integration:** On the dropdown, Choose `Docker`
4. **Integration Name:** Use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. `Example:docker-mydockerusername`
5. Enter your credentials
6. Click on `Save`

The integration will now be available to all your projects. To learn more about where this integration is used, check out our [Docker Registries Guide](docker_registries).

### Google Container Registry (GCR)

You will need this to pull or push images to Google Container Registry as part of building your project.

1. On the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), select the project you want to integrate with Shippable
2. In the sidebar on the left, expand 'APIs & auth' and select 'Credentials'
3. Click 'Create new Client ID' and select 'Service Account' in the pop-up window
4. Click on 'Create Client ID'. A dialog box appears. To proceed, click 'Okay, got it'
5. Your new Public/Private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine. Please store this carefully since you will not be able to retrieve this from your GDC account.

8. To add a new integration, click on ![add_icon](images/add_icon.gif)

## Delete an Integration

Before deleting an integration, make sure there are no dependencies. In other words, no downstream projects should be using this integration. Remember, the integration may be used by folks added to your subscription if your GitHub Account is an Organization.

Delete will fail if there are any projects actively using the integration.

To delete an integration:

- Click on the ![glass_icon](images/glass_icon.gif) next to the integration.
- Scroll down and click on the **Delete** button.
