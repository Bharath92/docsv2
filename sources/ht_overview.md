# How do I...

Shippable is a tremendously flexible platform and you can do almost anything with it. Well, except make coffee. We're working on that ;)

In the meantime, we have realized that it is almost impossible to document every scenario that can be accomplished with our platform. In our bid to die trying, we have a weekly blog series that addresses a specific scenario and walks you through a sample project. 

The list below lists the titles and links for all our 'How do I...' blogs.
